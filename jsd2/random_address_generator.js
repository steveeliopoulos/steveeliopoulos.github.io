/*Write a script that can generate random addresses.

1. As a first step, create arrays that contain dummy data for each of the following: 
   1. street number, 
   2. street name, 
   3. city name, 
   4. state name 
   5. postal code
2. Your script should randomly select one item from each of these arrays and then use them to construct a random address
3. Each time you run the script, it should print a new randomly-generated address to the console. 
4. For example: 1139 Grand Ave, Chicago, IL 60642*/l
